Using LeapMotion, we created an elegant user experience for browsing stock ticker data.
## Dynamically-sized objects
Ticker names are small to provide you access to all available tickers, but scale to large objects when hovered upon, for easy selection.
## Fluid and seamless design
We provide an elegant browsing solution, while still being pinpoint-accurate in the data we provide.
## Full-stack webapp with Node.js
We engineered a MEAN-inspired server, making our app totally accessible from the web.
